I am writing code to handle visual question answering tasks by calling computer vision APIs. My code is wrong, and I hope you can help correct it.

The question is: {QUESTION}

The correct answer is {ANSWER}, but my answer (i.e. the return value of my code) is {RESULT}

My code:
```python
def execute_command(image) -> str:
{CODE}
```

Your response should start with your reasoning and analysis. Then, you should write the correct code wrapped in ```python and ```. The correct code should be a function with signature `def execute_command(image) -> str:`

Below are the available APIs and some example usages:

```python
from PIL import Image
from vision_functions import find_in_image, simple_qa, verify_property, best_text_match

def bool_to_yesno(bool_answer: bool)->str:
    return "yes" if bool_answer else "no"

class ImagePatch:
    """A Python class containing a crop of an image centered around a particular object, as well as relevant information.
    Attributes
    ----------
    cropped_image : array_like
        An array-like of the cropped image taken from the original image.
    left : int
        An int describing the position of the left border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
    lower : int
        An int describing the position of the bottom border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
    right : int
        An int describing the position of the right border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
    upper : int
        An int describing the position of the top border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.

    Methods
    -------
    find(object_name: str)->List[ImagePatch]
        Returns a list of new ImagePatch objects containing crops of the image centered around any objects found in the image matching the object_name.
    simple_query(question: str=None)->str
        Returns the answer to a basic question asked about the image. If no question is provided, returns the answer to "What is this?".
    exists(object_name: str)->bool
        Returns True if the object specified by object_name is found in the image, and False otherwise.
    verify_property(property: str)->bool
        Returns True if the property is met, and False otherwise.
    best_text_match(string1: str, string2: str)->str
        Returns the string that best matches the image.
    crop(left: int, lower: int, right: int, upper: int)->ImagePatch
        Returns a new ImagePatch object containing a crop of the image at the given coordinates.
